To do this, we will set up an array of boxes through which our particles will diffuse, and we will specify the box in the center to initially have probability $1$ (i.e. *all* the particles are found here) and all other boxes will have probability $0$. To do that, we specify the number of boxes, the time increment, the number of time steps and the hopping rate. In general, the time increment needs to be smaller than the hopping timescale to ensure accurate estimation. "

    "Having developed the numerical method of integrating the master equation, let's consider its application to the problem of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). In FRAP experiments, the fluorescently labeled molecules initially have a uniform distribution. Applying high intensity light, the fluorescent molecules in the desired region get photobleached, meaning that they no longer fluoresce. Over time, the fluorescent molecules that were outside the photobleached region will diffuse into it, recovering the uniform fluorescence distribution. By estimating the timescale of fluorescence recovery, experimentalists can determine the diffusion constant of fluorescently labeled molecules.\n",
